The system is designed to handel challenging scenarios including low-light conditions,motion blur,varying angels,noise and low contrast.
Methods:
 Architecture:YOLOv8 with CSPDarknet backbone, specifically trained on a large dataset of Iranian vehicle images.
 Performance:Achieves high mean Average Precision (mAP) on Iranian plates, enabling precise localization even in cluttered or angled scenes.
 Model:CRNN-based architecture (v2) from Hezar AI.
 Designed:Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network optimized for Persian script and numeric characters found in Iranian plates.

The combination of specialized pre-trained models and
targeted preprocessing yields a highly effective system without the need for custom training from scratch.
